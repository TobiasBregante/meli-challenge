Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

That's all ðŸŽ‰

## Folder structure & routing

 - Inside `jsconfig.json`you will find most common used path alias 
 - All application code except `/pages`will be there
 - `@Page`is an app wrapper that works well in SSG, CSR, SSR to pass cache data, setting up custom providers. In case `_app.jsx` is not compatible.
 - `@/ui/` has all ui components in isolation, in case of not passed, they have self managed state
- `@/styles/` handled by build.scss that import all styles needed "including bootstrap" is where app styles live
- `@/utils/`has hooks, and function that can be reuse in other files
